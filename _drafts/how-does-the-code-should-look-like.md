The first chart library I used almost 15 years ago was [jpgraph](https://jpgraph.net/) for PHP, then after too much customization of its code I decided it was time to create my own library. I did it with ActionScript and Flash, it was called **Atomicharts**, it was doing few things: linecharts, areacharts and barcharts. I truly enjoyed the experience of putting together the library.

Then Javascript became the standard for everything web, and I spent a summer working with [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/). At that time Highcharts was **canvas** based, and we had to squeeze in a lot of time into the optimization of its code for IE9 ðŸ¥¶.

Then [prototype.js](http://prototypejs.org/) and eventually [D3](https://d3js.org/). D3 opened up a new universe of possibilities and fun. The feeling of freedom you get with D3 was unique: I could finally build whatever my imagination was suggesting.
