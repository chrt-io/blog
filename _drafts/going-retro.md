The visual language of old data visualization always amazed me: being able to represent complex data with few elements and colors, and yet making it readable is an exciting challenge.

The web is full of different examples, [Nightingale](https://medium.com/nightingale "DVS Nightingale"), the online magazine from the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org "DVS Website") has a lot of articles about the topic.

Recently, the work that[ W.E.B. Du Bois presented at the 1900 World Fair in Paris gained a lot of visibility](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/first-time-together-and-color-book-displays-web-du-bois-visionary-infographics-180970826/ "W.E.B. Du Boisâ€™ Visionary Infographics Come Together for the First Time in Full Color"), even with the publication of a [monographic book](https://amzn.to/3x6IK0u "Visualizing Black America: The Color Line at the Turn of the Twentieth Century") with all his charts.
