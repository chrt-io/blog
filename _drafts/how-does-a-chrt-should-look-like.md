At chrt we are always very excited when we create new charts ğŸ“Š. They have to be _neat and crisp_ ğŸ¤“. We all know Spear, Tufte, Few, Bertin, Wilkinson, Tukey and others, they have defined the best practices long ago, and still most of the charts that we see out in the wild (literally in the wild) are far behind these practices.
