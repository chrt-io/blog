The first chart library I used (almost 15 years ago) was [jpgraph](https://jpgraph.net/) for PHP, then after too much customization of its code, I decided it was time to create my library. I did it with ActionScript and Flash, it was called **Atomicharts**, it was doing few things: linecharts, areacharts and barcharts. I truly enjoyed the experience of putting together the library.

Then Javascript became the standard for everything web, and I spent a summer working with [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/). At that time Highcharts was **canvas-based**, and we had to squeeze in a lot of time into the optimization of its code for IE9 ü•∂.

Then I discovered [prototype.js](http://prototypejs.org/) and eventually [D3](https://d3js.org/). D3 opened up a new universe of possibilities and fun. The feeling of freedom you get with D3 was unique: I could finally build whatever my imagination was suggesting.

Most of the chart libraries start from a JSON-like config file, however, I don't think as humans we think in config-files üòõ. I never enjoyed these libraries, and that is the reason why I found myself starting from scratch with D3 every single time I wanted to build üèóÔ∏è a chart.

I played with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), I loved its way to declaratively creating graphics, based on **The Grammar of Graphics**, with the concept of components of the layered grammar ([A layered grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html)).

#### And here came **chrt**!

Inspired by ggplot2, d3 and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), we started thinking about a way of coding charts more _casually_ without compromising on the level of details that could be customized.

#### _How would I like to build a chart?_

After some tinkering around I scribbled ‚úçÔ∏è down the following:

    Chrt()
        .data([...])
        .add(xAxis())
        .add(yAxis())
        .add(lineChart())

This ‚òùÔ∏è was the first draft, and it was actually exciting!

Then I thought every building block should have a way to add other blocks:

    Chrt()
        .data([...])
        .add(
            xAxis().add(xAxisRange()
        )
        .add(
            yAxis().add(axisTitle())
        )
        .add(lineChart().add(Markers).add(Labels))

And what about customizing a single block? No JSON config files üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but simple chained methods to be called directly:

    lineChart()
        .color('#333')
        .opacity(0.4)
        .dashed()

This was an important milestone for **chrt**, figuring out how the code should look like gave us a direction to follow.
