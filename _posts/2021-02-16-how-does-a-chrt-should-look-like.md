At **chrt** we are always very excited 👯 when we create new charts 📊. They have to be _neat and crisp_ 🤓.

The big names 🧑‍🏫 👩‍🏫: Spear, Bertin, Wilkinson, Tukey, Few, Tufte and others, have all described the best practices long ago, and still most of the charts that we see out in the wild 🦁 (literally in the wild) are far behind these practices.

#### Luckily the wilderness 🦁 is not that wild 🐱.

There are examples of inspiring beautiful neat and crips charts. Datawrapper
