At **chrt** we are always very excited when we create new charts 📊. They have to be _neat and crisp_ 🤓.

We all know the big names 🧑‍🏫 👩‍🏫: Spear, Bertin, Wilkinson, Tukey, Few, Tufte and others. They have described the best practices long ago, and still most of the charts that we see out in the wild (literally in the wild) are far behind these practices.

#### Luckily the wilderness is not that wild.

There are examples of inspiring beautiful neat and crips charts. Datawrapper
