At **chrt** we are always very excited 👯 when we create new charts 📊.  
They have to be _neat and crisp_ 🤓.

The big names 🧑‍🏫 👩‍🏫 (Spear, Bertin, Wilkinson, Tukey, Few, Tufte and others) have all described the best practices long ago, and still for most of the charts that we see out in the wild 🦁 (literally in the wild) it seems like they have never known these practices.

#### Luckily the wilderness 🦁 is not that wild 🐱

There are examples of libraries and tools to generate inspiring beautiful charts. One of our preferred tool is [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/). Leading publications build charts with it. Datawrapper won't let you disappointed: the charts are beautifil, neat and easy to read - and they follow the best practices. In a way I would say they are _opinionated charts_: they let you customize almost everything without destroying years of research in data visualization with some questionably designed chart element (axis titles, annotations, labels...)

This doesn't quite often happens with chart libraries, historically you can do almost everything.
